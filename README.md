# clevis-decrypt-zfs

This was a quick side project, so I'm not going to try and explain much.

This go application was based on a script which I wrote to auto-decrypt my zfs
datasets using clevis
([link](https://gist.github.com/tcyrus/7fec45977e560030288805c2d2f64b29))

That script was based on a GitHub issue that I found on the clevis repo
([link](https://github.com/latchset/clevis/issues/218))

When digging deeper into clevis, I had trouble understanding all the
behaviours of [Tang](https://github.com/latchset/tang) and [Jose](https://github.com/latchset/jose).
